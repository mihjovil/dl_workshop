# dl_workshop
This repository has a quick overview of the most common Deep Learning applications in a jupyter file. It shows with two different datasets the architecture a VGG network (Convolutional layers) and a GRU network for a time series forecating example. The datasets are CIFAR10 and a dataset with the currency exchange rate of COP and USD. Also it illustrates the most basic aspects of how to define a DL model and it should in the end allow the reader to understand the basic operations of creating, training, saving and loading a model.
